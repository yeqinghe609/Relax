"""Apptainer (Singularity) + in-container ipykernel sandbox backend.

Targets the deepeyes_v2 recipe on hosts that have ``apptainer`` (>=1.2) but
no docker daemon — common on shared HPC / Slurm clusters. Apptainer is
daemon-less and rootless, reads OCI / docker images via the
``docker://<ref>`` URI (transparently pulled and cached by apptainer
itself) or a prebuilt ``.sif`` file.

Architecture:
  * one container per session, running ``python -m ipykernel_launcher``
  * jupyter_client.AsyncKernelClient over ZMQ on **AF_UNIX (IPC)** sockets,
    not TCP. Each session writes its 5 ZMQ channels to socket files inside
    its own session-scoped tempdir; the tempdir is identity-bind-mounted
    into the container so the same path resolves to the same inode on
    both sides. Eliminates the 5-port allocation race that surfaced as
    ``zmq.error.ZMQError: Address already in use`` at >32 concurrent
    create_sessions on TCP transport.
  * file IO goes through host-side bind mounts (the recipe's image and
    output dirs are mapped from a session-scoped host tempdir into the
    container at well-known paths) — much cheaper than ``exec_run``-style
    round-trips and the only reason ``list_files`` / ``read_bytes`` /
    ``delete_files`` work at all without a long-lived control channel
    inside the container.

Image requirements: must include ``ipykernel`` (no defensive auto-install).
The user-supplied apptainer image is treated as authoritative.
