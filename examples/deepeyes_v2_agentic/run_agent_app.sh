# Per-session stdout+stderr capture. Relax captures the subprocess streams
# into a tmpdir/command.log and only surfaces it when the agent exits with
# code != 0 (relax/agentic/pipeline/runtime.py:358); the tmpdir is then
# cleaned up (runtime.py:397), so silent-success failures (subprocess exits
# 0 but never produced a chat IR) leave no trace, and successful sessions
# leave no trace either — both make hang/perf debugging impossible.
#
# Mirrors nemo_gym_agentic/run_agent_app.sh: tee both streams to a
# persistent per-session file keyed by AGENT_DEBUG_LOG_DIR (set by the
# training launcher to log/agent/${TIMESTAMP}) and keep ALL logs regardless
# of exit code. The training script picks a fresh ${TIMESTAMP} directory
# per run so logs don't pile up across runs.
